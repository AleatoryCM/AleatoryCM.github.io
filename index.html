			<h2>My Story!</h2>
			<p>Hi there! My name's Cass Aleatory (or just Cassie if you prefer). You might also know me as @rk_firestorm, the handle I use across all my social media platforms. I'm an independent game developer and writer. While telling stories is my specialty, I'm also a pretty experienced programmer who's worked in C#, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and Processing (Java based). I enjoy experimenting with other game development roles in my spare time, including composition, sound design, graphics art, community management, and user experience design.</p>

			<p>I graduated from Verona Area High School in the spring of 2017, and am currently working towards two Bachelor's degrees. I'm a triple major in English: Professional Writing & Publishing, Media Arts & Game Development: Technology, and Film Studies at the University of Wisconsin in Whitewater. I'm also a member of the University Honors Program there.</p>

			<p>Nowadays, I work mostly on projects of my own choosing that have personal significance to me. My stories tend to be character-based narratives that deal with themes of emotional and mental struggle, and how love, friendship, and communication are affected by the things that go on inside people's heads. I also enjoy writing metagame and nonlinear stories from time to time.</p>

			<p>I'm currently hard at work on several large projects, including the character-driven, decisions-matter, multiple-act <i>Exarch</i> and <i>End of The Party</i>, a randomized-yet-decision-based light-hearted RPG. Even though I'm really stressed out 110% of the time, I'm always keeping my eyes open for even <i>more</i> projects that offer me the chance to tell cool stories. If you want to hire or work with me, check the "Contact Me" section below to learn how to reach out!</p>
