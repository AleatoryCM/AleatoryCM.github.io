			<h2>Announcements</h2>

			<p><b>01/17/2025</b> — As of today, most of this website is being taken down for maintenance. It's been long enough since I last updated it (2021) that it's overdue for a complete overhaul. However, I didn't get around to it within two months of my big itch.io update that likely rendered half the links dead, so I'm cutting my losses and releasing a minor update in the short term, adding this informal announcements section and removing all the projects that are no longer up. When the overhaul does come, expect a fresh design, a better system for hosting my non-fiction and professional writing projects (which are all unavailable for now), and downloadable files for items like my resume and courseography (these sections are also gone for now, as they're too old to be of much use in 2025). Thanks for your patience!</p>

			<p><b>01/16/2025</b> — Rest in peace, David Lynch. In light of this cult cinema legend's passing, I'm thinking about adding a tribute in the Log Lady <i>Twin Peaks</i> fangame I made back in university. Don't expect anything in the short term; I want to give this the careful consideration it deserves. I'll only do it when I'm confident I can do it right (and hopefully in a way he'd approve of).</p>

			<p><b>11/15/2024</b> — My itch.io page has been overhauled—I've commented on most of my old projects' statuses, taken a few projects down for various reasons, and provided some insight into my game development priorities going forward. If you want to see for yourself, you can find a link to my itch.io profile at the bottom of this page. The short version is this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Development on "AGLST," my former flagship project, has been suspended indefinitely.</li>
				<li>"ESCAPE," my perennial favorite, is my new flagship project (for now). Development has already begun on what will likely be its final update, ESCAPE: Ultimate. In addition to expanded dialogue that allows for more nuanced characterization, expect: more flexibility in where you go, items you can use to aid your journey, a more sophisticated system for tracking characters' opinions of you, two new major characters, and a new overarching story that allows players to make decisions that truly matter. My goal is to have this update released by Fall of 2025. Please see ESCAPE's page on either itch.io or this website for more information.</li>
				<li>"Look Closer," which has consistently been the most popular of my projects, will be getting an update sometime in 2025 or 2026. It'll feature an expanded story, new quests to explore, new characters to meet, further metacommentary on the high fantasy genre, and dragons. <i>More</i> dragons.</li>

			<h2>My Story</h2>

			<p>Hi there! My name's Cass Aleatory. I graduated from Verona Area High School in the spring of 2017, and then from UW-Whitewater in the spring of 2022. I hold two Bachelor's degrees, and I majored in Professional Writing & Publishing, Media Arts & Game Development: Technology, and Film Studies. I was also a member of the University Honors Program there.</p>

			<p>Nowadays, I work as a contracted grant proposal writer, and I'm hoping to finally continue some of my old storytelling projects in my spare time. In addition to creative and professional writing, my skills include developmental editing, copyediting, critical/analytical writing, front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap), the Unity and Twine game engines, and CSS and Java programming.</p>
