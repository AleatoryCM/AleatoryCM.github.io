    		<h3>About</h3><br>
    		<p>End of the Party features decision-based, randomized gameplay that ensures no two playthroughs will be identical. The heroes comprising the enemy party, the environment they must travel through, and even the events that occur along the way will be randomly chosen from a huge pool of possibilities. You can build out your character's ability set to your liking and handle the scenarios you're confronted with however you deem fit. But choose carefully, as the decisions you make along the way might just help you later on... or come back to haunt you.</p>

    		<p>This game marks a lot of firsts for me: my first time working on a 3D game, my first large-scale collaboration, and my first community-driven game (meaning that we're trying to create a living fanbase for the game instead of releasing it and walking away). Overall, I couldn't be more thrilled to work on this project with so many collaborators who number among my best friends and highest-regarded fellow developers in the MAGD program.</p>

    		<p>While End of The Party won't officially offer an open beta release until at least December of 2020, make sure to follow the itch.io page linked above, which will feature both updates and live demos covering the creation of the game as it happens. You can also engage with the game and its community by joining its <a href="https://discord.gg/eURzmXx">Discord server</a>.</p>

    		<h3>What I Did</h3><br>
    		<p>I wrote the scenarios and designed the story structure. Leah and Wes programmed the game. Wes also worked on sound effects and audio design. Sydney did the graphics art, particle effects, and some modeling. Damian did modeling. Alyssa handled the soundtrack.</p>
