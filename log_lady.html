    		<h3>About</h3><br>
    		<p>Play as the Log Lady in this story based adventure set in the world of <i>Twin Peaks</i>! There are still so many secrets to be discovered here... what will you find on your journey? This game is my contribution to the <i>Twin Peaks</i> fan community. Even though this game is nothing official, it's fan content like this that helps keep the communities of so many beloved franchises alive. After all the inspiration <i>Twin Peaks</i> has provided me, this is my way of saying "thank you."</p>

    		<p>The underlying mechanical and narrative complexity of this game meant that it challenged me as both a developer and a writer. Whereas ESCAPE is 90% story, this game incorporates exploration, gameplay mechanics, and trivia in an attempt to tell a story in classic <i>Twin Peaks</i> style; it's more of a feeling or experience than a concrete idea or plot.</p>

    		<p>This game consists of three main activities, called "phases." In SPEAK phases, you get to talk to classic <i>Twin Peaks</i> characters. Simply click on the text option that you would like to say. There are no right or wrong answers. In MEND phases, characters will ask you questions that will test your knowledge of medium to difficult <i>Twin Peaks</i> trivia. Look for a question in what the character has said, and type your reply in the input box in the bottom left of the interface. In RAISE phases, you must use your log to catch every BOB on the screen. Move your log with WASD or the arrow keys, and collide with a BOB to catch and eliminate him.</p>

    		<p>Working on this game taught me a lot about Unity as a platform. Since this was my first storytelling project in Unity, I had to figure out for myself the best way to handle player input, branching story paths, and many other things that were automated in Twine. Even outside purely narrative-focused development, the fact that I was working alone gave me lots of practice dealing with the more routine aspects of Unity game development, such as writing basic scripts and managing sprites.</p>

    		<h3>What I Did</h3><br>
    		<p>I created the log sprite, the character of Sierra, all of the code, all of the design, the user interface, the sound effects, and the story. I don't take credit for any of the rest of this game's content; it belongs solely to those who hold the rights to it and is only used here in the context of fanfiction. As a result of its presence, no monetization of this game will ever occur, and donations won't be accepted.</p>
