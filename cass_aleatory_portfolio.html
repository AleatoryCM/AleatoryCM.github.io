    		<h3>About</h3><br>
    		<p>I created this portfolio to show off all my other work! In the game development industry, having an organized and holistic presentation of yourself and the work you do is extremely important. While my itch.io page doesn't do a bad job of this, it's not easy to include non-game written works, which are an important part of my portfolio.</p>

    		<p>The only way to guaranteed my entire diverse body of work is represented just how I wanted was to create a framework myself... so here we are. This custom-build website is designed to show off everything I've created, be it text, game, or something different, in an organized and accessible manner.</p>

    		<p>I decided to include the website itself in my portfolio as a nod to an area of development I've been practicing for quite a few years now; while web design will never be my focus, the practice I got in MAGD 270: Web Development has helped make me a competent web creator. While I don't know any JavaScript, I'm otherwise well-equipped to design interesting websites, especially those for smaller-scale projects that I may already be writing for.</p>
